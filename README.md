# Riverwater_qualityanalysis

In this project, we aim to improve water quality prediction using a combination of ML models and 
explainable AI methods. We begin with baseline models such as:
**Logistic Regression** and progressively explore more sophisticated techniques like **SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests**, and 
**Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**. **Among these, MLP achieved the highest accuracy at 98%.** To address 
interpretability, we employ **SHAP and LIME** (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). 
SHAP helps quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction, offering a unified and 
consistent explanation for complex outputs. LIME, on the other hand, builds local surrogate models 
to provide insight into specific predictions. Together, **these XAI tools help bridge the gap between 
accuracy and transparency, allowing both technical experts and decision-makers to understand and 
trust the predictions.**
